## My process

### Built with

  - Semantic HTML5
  - CSS3 custom properties
  - Flexbox for layout
  - Media queries for responsive design
  - Google Fonts – Outfit and Young Serif
  - Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

- How to use semantic HTML for better structure and accessibility.
  - How to structure a responsive layout with flex-direction: column.
  - How to use calc() in CSS:
    - width: calc(100% + 4rem);
    - This helped me create edge-to-edge images on mobile screens.
  - Applying box-sizing: border-box to simplify spacing and layout sizing.
  - Custom list styles with ::marker for better control over bullet aesthetics.
  - Maintaining consistent spacing and layout with utility classes (e.g. .spaced-list).


### Continued development

In the future, I plan to:
  - Add accessibility improvements like better focus states and ARIA labels.
  - Use CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
  - Explore using clamp() and other modern CSS functions for fluid typography and spacing.
  - Convert this static page to a React component using a framework like Next.js.
  - Improve image optimization and lazy loading. 


### Useful resources

 - MDN Web Docs – for checking calc(), media queries, and list styling.
  - CSS Tricks - Box Sizing – helpful for understanding layout behavior.
